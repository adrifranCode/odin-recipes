			<li>On a floured surface, roll each ball into a circle roughly 8 inches (20-cm) in diameter.</li>
			<li>Heat a tawah or flat frying pan over medium-high heat. Coat with oil and place a round of dough on the pan.</li>
			<li>Cook the dough until light brown, watching carefully, about 5 minutes. Then flip and cook on the other side, about 3-4 minutes more. Repeat with the remaining dough rounds.</li>
